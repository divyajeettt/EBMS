\section{Database Schema \& Integrity Constraints}

Most of the data for the entity tables was generated through \href{https://www.mockaroo.com/}{Mockaraoo}.
Mockaroo was used to implement viable constraints on the data being generated.
Since the records of the relationship tables are dependent on the records of the entity tables, they were generated using Python scripts.

The complete database schema and generated records, along with the generator, can be found in the \texttt{Database-Generation/} directory in the project repository.
