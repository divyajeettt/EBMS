\section{Stakeholders and their roles}

Stakeholders are the people who will be directly or indirectly affected by the project.
They are the people who will be using the system, and hence, their requirements are of utmost importance.

\begin{stakeholder}[Customers]
The customers are the primary stakeholders who will be interacting with the database.
A customer will first have to register and log in.
Once done, they can start adding products to their cart, track their orders, and make secure paymments.
The application will also allow them to view their transaction history.
Some customer-related actions are as follows:
