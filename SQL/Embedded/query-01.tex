\textbf{Feature:} This query is used to display the entire product catalogue. \\
\textbf{Location:} In function \texttt{search()} in \texttt{front-end/\_\_init\_\_.py}

\begin{lstlisting}
SELECT p.name, p.price, AVG(pr.rating) AS avg_rating, p.quantity
FROM product p, product_review pr
WHERE p.productID = pr.productID
GROUP BY p.productID
ORDER BY p.name ASC;
\end{lstlisting}

A variation of the same query (which uses pattern matching in SQL) is also used to search through the product catalogue.
\footnote{
    \ In this variant of the query, \texttt{search} is a string which the user wishes to search for.
    The string is substituted into the query using an \texttt{f-string} in Python.
}

\begin{lstlisting}
SELECT p.name, p.price, AVG(pr.rating) AS avg_rating, p.quantity
FROM product p, product_review pr
WHERE p.productID = pr.productID AND p.name LIKE '%{search}%'
GROUP BY p.productID
ORDER BY p.name ASC;
\end{lstlisting}

This variant can also be found in the function \texttt{search()} in \texttt{front-end/\_\_init\_\_.py}. \\
