\textbf{Feature:} This query is used to display the entire product catalogue. \\
\textbf{Location:} In function \texttt{search()} in \texttt{front-end/\_\_init\_\_.py}

\begin{lstlisting}
(
    SELECT p.name, p.price, AVG(pr.rating) AS avg_rating, p.quantity
    FROM product p, product_review pr
    WHERE p.productID = pr.productID
    GROUP BY p.productID
) UNION (
    SELECT p.name, p.price, "No Reviews", p.quantity
    FROM product p
    WHERE p.productID NOT IN (SELECT productID FROM product_review)
)
ORDER BY name ASC;
\end{lstlisting}

A variation of the same query (which uses pattern matching in SQL) is also used to search through the product catalogue.
It is obtained by the addition of a \texttt{LIKE} clause as a condition.
This variant can also be found in the function \texttt{search()} in \texttt{front-end/\_\_init\_\_.py}. \\
