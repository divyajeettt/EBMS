\textbf{Feature:} This query is used to find out a supplier's statistics by date and region. \\
\textbf{Location:} This query has not been added yet, as it is a supplier-specific query and supplier-pages are not yet implemented.

\textbf{Usage:}
A supplier's sales grouped by a particular month/year and country are returned by this query.
We can separate this rolled up data into monthly, yearly, and country-wise trends.
\footnote{
    Here, \texttt{s\_id} is the supplier ID of the currently logged in supplier.
    The string is substituted into the query using an \texttt{f-string} in Python.
