\textbf{Feature:} This query is used to retrieve the demographics of customer activity. \\
\textbf{Location:} In function \texttt{admin\_stats(page)} in \texttt{front-end/\_\_init\_\_.py}

\textbf{Usage:}
When the HTML page is rendered, the rolled-up data is separated by regional demographics (country and state).
The data contains the number of customers that are registered on EBMS grouped by country and state.
Empty values in the field \texttt{state} indicate that the data is an aggregate of country-wise data.
The data record where country is empty gives the global aggregated data.
The average spending per order along with total spending is also shown.
