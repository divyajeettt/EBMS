\textbf{Feature:} This query is used to find out the country-wise trends in the number of orders and revenue. \\
\textbf{Location:} In function \texttt{admin\_stats(page)} in \texttt{front-end/\_\_init\_\_.py}

\textbf{Usage:}
When the HTML page is rendered, the rolled-up data is separated.
Due to an overwhelmingly large number of states, cities, etc., the data is grouped by country only.
The query can be extended to rollup with states, cities, etc. by adding them to the \texttt{SELECT} and \texttt{GROUP BY} clause.
The data record where country is empty gives the total global revenue and order count.

JOIN product p ON op.productID = p.productID
JOIN customer c ON o.customerID = c.customerID
JOIN address a ON c.addressID = a.addressID
GROUP BY a.country WITH ROLLUP
ORDER BY revenue DESC;
